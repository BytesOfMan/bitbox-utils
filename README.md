# bitbox-utils

A collection of dev scripts for performing various BCH and SLP transactions using `bitbox-sdk` and `slp-sdk`

## Dev

This is a bundle of scripts intended for advanced users. It's not particularly user friendly. Still, there are some basic scripts which could save time or be expanded on.

1. Rename `keys.js.sample` to `keys.js`
2. Populate with your own wallet information. `createBchWalletsBatch.js`, `createBchWalletSingle.js`, and `createSlpWalletSingle.js` are useful scripts for this. For now, the output must be copy pasted manually.

## Prod

1. Clean up the work I've done so far and submit to the `examples` section of `bitbox-sdk` and `slp-sdk`
2. Big props ;)
